# RTI-for-PowerPlatform

This repository is a placeholder for the Fabric Real-Time Intelligence for Power Platform - Demo assets. 
As I package up and deliver the assets for the demo, I'll add them here.

I'll update this doc with instructions as soon as it's 'complete-ish'. (There were some pending product updates, once those are released, I'll take fresh screenshots and verify the instructions. 

In the meantime - the gist is to import the excel file with the BikePoints (as accounts) - Then follow the labs.
The Power BI report needs to be connected to your Dataverse-Fabric Lakehouse - and to the EventStore that should be created through the lab.

Scott.
